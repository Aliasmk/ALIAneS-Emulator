#ALIAneS Emulation Project#
* Michael Kafarowski
* Project start date : March 10th 2015

###Current Progress and To do's###

CPU Complete! Bronze goal achieved! 

PPU in development! We have basic emulation of background and sprites. Donkey Kong, Pinball and other simple games work great.
Scrolling, sprite 0 hit, palettes, masking and other features still need to be implemented.

###Project Goals###

I have a tier'd goal structure for this project:

- Bronze: Achieve CPU emulation - DONE!
- Silver: Achieve PPU emulation. Games should run at >5 frames per second. 
- Gold: Add very basic mapper support. Games should approach comfortable speeds if not already.
- Platinum: Add more mapper support and APU emulation. Games should run at or higher than full speed.


###Terms###

* CPU - Central Processing Unit : The chip that takes care of reading and executing instructions that appear in memory.
* PPU - Pixel Processing Unit : The chip that accepts commands from the CPU and using special tables in its own memory, takes care of drawing sprites and backgrounds to the screen.
* APU - Audio Processing Unit : Takes care of the game sound generation.
* More defined terms coming soon.

###About###

This is a project I am undertaking to learn more about a lot of things: advanced C++ coding, emulation, microprocessors, assembly language... etc. I am having a lot of fun with the development of this software as well, and regardless of how the final product turns out, this has already proven to be an amazing learning experience.
